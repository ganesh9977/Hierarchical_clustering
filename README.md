# Hierarchical_clustering
# PROJECT TITLE :
Analysis and prediction of "malls_customers".csv of American Mall Market called as Pheonix Mall to findout on the basis of client requirement of dendrogram using scripy Graphics Library with the help of 'scripy.cluster.hierarch',to ace the no. of linkage of clustering of predict
# Problem statement :
The American finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as Highest no. of growth in their business market
As a Datascience engineer findout which hierarchy cluster give maximum linkage in upcoming future
# TASKS :
1.with help of scipy library import libraries and dataset
2.using the dendrogram to find the optimal No.of cluster
3.create hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib

# CONCLUSION :
According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster NO. 3 has highest number of linkages
# INSIGHTS :
1.Cluster 1 contains ("red")color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto Annual income approximately 139k$

2.cluster 2 contains "blue" color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 79-80k$

3.cluster 3 contains "green" color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 138-139k$

4.cluster 4 contains "cyan" color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 40k$

5.cluster 5 contains "pink" color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 40-42k$
